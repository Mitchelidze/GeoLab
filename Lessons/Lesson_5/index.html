          <span class="orange">HTML</span> is a computer language devised to
          allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone
          else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with
          the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite
          powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing
          revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the
          growing Internet audience under the direction of the
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
            ><span class="green">» W3C</span></a
          >, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the
          language. The definition of HTML is
          <span class="orange">HyperText Markup Language</span>. HyperText is
          the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on
          special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page.
          Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a
          certain type of text.

          <span class="orange">CSS</span> stands for
          <span class="orange">Cascading Style Sheets</span> with an emphasis
          placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document
          (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to
          embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies
          your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all
          determined with <span class="orange">CSS</span>. Think of HTML as the
          foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices
          (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a
          mid-century modern home).CSS brings style to your web pages by
          interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML
          components of a web page.In CSS, the selector is written to the left
          of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is
          called a declaration, and it contains properties and values.
