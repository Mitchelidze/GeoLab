        Tom Justice was once a cyclist chasing Olympic gold. Then he began using
        his bike for a much different purpose: robbing banks.

          <span class="letter-box ">t</span> man in the baseball cap
          and sunglasses waited for the teller to notice him. The morning of May
          26, 2000, was quiet inside the LaSalle Bank in suburban Highland Park.
          Standing patiently by the velvet ropes, the man looked at his
          wristwatch. The second hand ticked slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “May I help you?” said the young woman behind the counter, smiling.
          The man reached to the back of his khakis, as if to fish out a wallet.
          Instead, he presented her with a 3-by-5-inch index card. The teller’s
          smile wilted. She stared at the words handwritten in black marker:
          <span class="uppercase-italic"
            >“this is a robbery. put all of your money in the bag.”</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The man, who would later be described to the police as a slender,
          clean-shaven white man in his 20s wearing a light blue oxford shirt,
          returned the note card to his pocket. “Nice and easy,” he said coolly,
          handing over a white plastic shopping bag from Sports Authority. While
          the teller anxiously transferred bundles of cash, the man held his
          hands at his heart, gently pressing his palms together as if he were
          about to whisper, <span class="italic">Namaste</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The street was empty: no cars, no pedestrians. Suddenly the man
          spotted a police officer riding a four-wheel ATV. Squeezing the
          shopping bag, he settled into a relaxed gait. As the ATV approached,
          the robber smiled and waved hello, as would anyone who had not just
          knocked over a bank. Returning a stiff nod, the officer kept rolling.
          And so did the man, descending into a parking garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not 60 seconds later, he emerged, carrying an aluminum bicycle on one
          shoulder and a messenger bag over the other and wearing a red, white,
          and blue spandex bodysuit, a silver helmet, sunglasses with yellow
          lenses, and a pair of cycling shoes. He climbed onto the bike, clicked
          into the pedals, and began to ride leisurely. It had been less than
          three minutes since he exited the bank.

          <span class="anyone-a">"a</span>nyone interested in racing, bring your
          bike, and try your luck,” a voice announced over the tinny loudspeaker
          at the Ed Rudolph Velodrome in Northbrook. Seated in the bleachers,
          13-year-old Tom Justice was in awe of the cyclists careening around
          the outdoor track. Every time the pack whirled by, it cut the air,
          unleashing a concentrated whoosh.
        </p>
        <p class="content-post">
          Before that summer of 1983, Tom had never seen a bicycle race, let
          alone a velodrome. When his friend Kristin invited him to go, the
          skinny teen with straight black hair said yes only because he had a
          crush on her. But the moment they entered the stadium, he was
          transfixed.
